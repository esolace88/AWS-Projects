# AWS Projects

Welcome to my AWS Projects repository! This repository serves as a collection of practical projects demonstrating the use of various AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud Services. The primary aim is to provide hands-on examples for deploying and managing applications in the AWS Cloud.

## Repository Contents

Currently, this repository focuses on two key areas of AWS:

1. **Elastic Cache:** This section showcases how to deploy a service that utilizes AWS Elastic Cache. Elastic Cache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying solely on slower disk-based databases.

2. **CloudFormation:** Here, you'll find examples demonstrating how to use AWS CloudFormation. CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. It allows you to use AWS and third-party application resources, create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, and provision and update them in an orderly and predictable way.

3. **EventBus & Lambda:** This project focuses on how to leverage the EventBus and Lambda services in AWS. It demonstrates how to set up a serverless event-driven architecture using AWS Lambda functions that respond to events sent to an Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) EventBus.

Each project resides in its respective folder and includes a detailed README file explaining the project's specifics, including the problem statement, approach, and results.
